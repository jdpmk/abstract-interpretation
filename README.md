# Abstract Interpretation

An implementation of [abstract interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_interpretation),
a static analysis method which can be used to prove certain properties of a
program by performing an interpretation of the program over an abstract domain.

### Features

First, we need the following:
- [x] AST
- [x] concrete interpreter
- [ ] type-checking

Some abstract domains it would be useful to support:
- [x] sign
- [ ] parity
- [ ] intervals

Other desirable features:
- [ ] statically-checked inline annotations
- [ ] lexer and parser
